                        <p>
                            Prepare to brew your coffee by boiling water in the kettle and grounding the desired amount of
                            coffee beans. The coffee beans should typically be ground at a relatively fine setting for this
                            process. You'll want a 16:1 ratio of water to beans, so keep that in mind. Place your filter
                            inside the pourover contraption and place the contraption on the kitchen scale.

                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Step Three: Pour, pour, pour!</h3>
                        <p>
                            With the boiling water, rinse the filter in a circular motion. Empty the water from the carafe 
                            into the sink. This gets rid of any paper-y taste the filter might give the coffee. Then, fill 
                            a mug of choice with some of the boiling water. This keeps the cup (and the coffee, which will 
                            be added later,) warm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, tare the scale. Place the coffee grounds on top of the filter. Normally 20g of grounds makes 
                            an average sized cup of coffee, but feel free to adjust this number depending on how many cups you 
                            plan on making. Pour the water slowly in a circular motion over the grounds until the water just 
                            barely covers them. Wait for 30 seconds. This allows the coffee to bloom, which is the release of 
                            air bubbles from the grounds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the coffee has bloomed, continue to add water in the same circular motion until you've reached
                            your 16:1 ratio. Take pouring breaks if the water gets too high, and avoid pouring water straight on
                            the filter. Aim for the grounds, instead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After all the water has dripped from the grounds into the carafe, your coffee is made! Dump the water
                            you previously added to your mug and replace with freshly brewed coffee. Add cream and sugar to taste.
                        </p>

                <h3>Step Four: Clean Up</h3>
                <p>
                    Cleaning your contraption is an important step and allows for better coffee later. Avoid cleaning with soap and 
                    use just hot water instead. Remember that your filter and used coffee grounds can be composted as well.

            <div class="p-3 mb-2">
                <h3>Some Final Words</h3>
                <p>
                    Remember that this process of making coffee takes some time to master. Do not be discouraged if your
                    first cup doesn't come out as perfect as you might have hoped. Make adjustments as needed. Some prefer
                    their coffee to be stronger (in which case your ratio might look more like 13:1) and others prefer it
                    to be slightly less strong (so your ratio might be closer to 19:1 or 20:1). The kind of beans you use
                    may also affect the type of cup you make, along with how fine you grind the beans. Experiment, and take
                    joy in this newfound morning (and afternoon and evening) routine.
